Our Story (content)

After spending a chunk of time working at Disneyland and spending a lot of time with the Characters, Wish Upon a Star owner, Hayley Luhn, decided that she had a passion for bringing the magic of fairy tales to Washington State.  Through appearances at birthday parties and charity or corporate events, every child (young and old alike) can enjoy the enchantment of fairy tales come to life.

Wish Upon a Star character parties is committed to providing a quality, fun experience for everyone.  With a special emphasis on the principles of kindness, love, friendship, sharing and giving- every child is sure to come away with a great life lesson!  Our Princess friends teach guests that these qualities, not just sparkly gowns and tiaras, are what makes a true princess. 

At our Character parties, our friends will read stories to guests, enjoy arts and crafts themed to their story, play games, sing songs and dance with guests.  We have special activities planned for our appearances, however our character friends are happy to be a part of whatever you have planned out.  Our character friends will also find a special time for photos and autographs with the guest of honor and his/her guests.

We have many character friends who would love to join you for your event or for your child's special day.  Please take a look at our Character page to see which friends are currently available and waiting to join you at your event!  

We are so excited to make special memories with you and your guests!
